@article{Cincotta1999,
abstract = {We have recently introduced a new method of searching a time series for periodic variability. The method uses the Shannon entropy to measure the amount of information provided by a set of observations that may contain an underlying periodic signal, as a function of the assumed period of this hypothetical periodic signal. Here we present the analytical arguments that support this algorithm within the broader frame of information theory. We also show that, in the absence of a periodic signal, the entropies follow a Gaussian distribution, which then provides an easy way of assessing the significance of a positive detection. We test this method using simulated data with non-sinusoidal variability, and we show that it is more sensitive than the classical periodograms or those variations adapted to deal with cases where harmonics are involved. Finally, we show that this method is capable of resolving two, almost identical, frequencies present in a given time series, even in cases where the classical periodograms fail to do so.},

abstract = {During recent years there has been more and more emphasis upon astronomical measurements in the infrared. To a great extent, this increased emphasis has been stimulated by recent detector developments, which have produced detectors capable of making the difﬁcult long-wavelength observations. Baum (1) has reviewed the characteristics of photosensitive devices, including infrared detectors. He discussed the spectral responses and sensi- tivities of most of the available detectors and, rather than dissert upon this subject here, we refer the reader to Baum's article. For the purposes of this discussion, we will divide the infrared spectrum as follows: (a) The Near Infrared, from the visible region to approximately 1 u. This region corresponds to the wavelength sensitivity range of photomulti- pliers having S-1 cathodes. (b) The Intermediate Infrared, covering the range of wavelengths from 1 p. to 4 pi, approximately. This region corresponds to the wavelength range for optimum sensitivity of lead sulﬁde photoconductive cells, cooled by liquid nitrogen. (0) The Far Infrared, covering the range of wavelengths from 4 it to 22 p, approximately. There are several newly developed detectors that are sensitive in this spectral region, but the most sensitive is the liquid helium-cooled germanium bolometer developed by F. J. Low (2). Wavelengths longer than approximately 22 pi will not, for the purposes of the present discussion, be considered as belonging to the infrared, although Low (3) has used his germanium bolometer to make astronomical measurements at 1 mm.},

The revised Yerkes Atlas system (MK) of spectral classification is taken as standard. The latter is described briefly, and a list of standard stars is included. Magnitudes and color indices from measures in three wave4ength bands are given for stars selected by spectral type and luminosity class to be representative of the principal regions of the H-R diagram. A few white dwarfs are also included. A standard main sequence is defined for the new color-absolute magnitude diagram by the use of stars of large parallax, together with the galactic clusters NGC 2362, the Pleiades, the Ursa Major nucleus, and Praesepe. A standard mnin sequence is also defined for the relationship between the two systems of color index. A purely photometric method for determining spectral types and space reddening for B stars in galactic clusters is described.},

abstract = {We use the recently released OGLE-III catalog of 17,692 fundamental mode RR Lyr (RRab) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to investigate the structure of its stellar halo. We apply conservative cuts in period, amplitude, and magnitude to remove blends and other contamination. We use period-luminosity and period-color relations to determine distance and extinction of every star in our final sample of 9393 stars. In order to determine the scatter of our method, we compare the distributions of distances in two regions at the edges of the covered area with a central region. We determine the intrinsic line-of-sight dispersion in the center to be 0.135 mag or 3.21 kpc (FWHM of 0.318 mag or 7.56 kpc), assuming zero depth in one of the edge regions. The conservative cuts we apply reduce the derived depth significantly. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of RRab stars is deformed in the sense that stars on the eastern side are closer than on the western side. We model the RRab distribution as a triaxial ellipsoid and determine its axes ratios to be 1:2.00:3.50 with the longest axis inclined by 6° from the line of sight. Another result of our analysis is an extinction map of the LMC and a map of internal reddening, which we make publicly available.},

abstract = {We present a careful and detailed light curve analysis of publicly available {\$}I{\$}-band data on fundamental mode RR Lyrae (RRab) stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) obtained by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) phase-III project. Using the Fourier parameters of {\$}13,095{\$} RRab stars, metallicities and absolute magnitudes of individual stars are obtained. The representation of stars on the {\$}P-\backslashphi{\_}{\{}31{\}}{\^{}}{\{}V{\}}{\$} plane shows the existence of three significant metallicity groups with mean metallicities as {\$}-1.20 \backslashpm 0.12{\$} dex, {\$}-1.57 \backslashpm 0.10{\$} dex and {\$}-1.89 \backslashpm 0.09{\$} dex. The corresponding absolute magnitudes of these three groups are obtained as {\$}0.70\backslashpm 0.08{\$} mag, {\$}0.59 \backslashpm 0.06{\$} mag and {\$}0.49 \backslashpm 0.08{\$} mag, respectively. Distribution of these three groups as a function of vertical {\$}|z|{\$} distance indicates that the formation of the LMC disk predates the formation of the inner halo. Issue of the existence of a metallicity gradient as a function of galactocentric distances has also been addressed.   Approximating the structure of the LMC disk as a triaxial ellipsoid, the inclination angle ({\$}i{\$}) relative to the plane of the sky and the position angle of the line of nodes ({\$}\backslashtheta{\_}{\{}lon{\}}{\$}) were estimated as {\$}24{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}.20{\$} and {\$}176{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}.01{\$}, respectively.
